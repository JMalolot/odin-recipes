		<h3>Description</h3>
		<p>When it comes to pie crust, the type of fat you use makes all the difference.</p> 
		<p>This pie crust calls for shortening, which is easy to incorporate into the</p> 
		<p>dough and makes the crust easier to roll out. Plus, a pie crust with</p> 
		<p>shortening holds its shape better than others. This means it's a great choice if you're planning to make a decorative pie.</p>
	
		<h1>Ingredients</h1>
		<ul>
			<li>2 cups of all purpose flour</li>
			<li>1 teaspoon of salt</li>
			<li>1 cup shortening, cut into small pieces and frozen for 30 minutes</li>
			<li>1/2 Ice Water</li>
		</ul>

		<h1>Steps</h1>
		<ol>
			<li><strong>Step 1: </strong></li>
			<p>Whisk together flour and salt in a large bowl. Cut in chilled shortening with a pastry blender until the mixture resembles coarse, pea-sized crumbs.</p>
			<li><strong>Step 2: </strong></li>
			<p>Add 1/4 cup ice-cold water; use a fork to stir the flour up from the bottom, just until it's mixed in. Press down on any chunks and continue working the</p>
			<p>dough around the bowl. Continue to add ice-cold water, in 1 tablespoon increments, mixing just until dough is moist enough to hold together when</p>
            <p>molded; you will not need more than 4 tablespoons and in fact, may need less. Do not add too much water!</p>
			<li><strong>Step 3: </strong></li>
			<p>Gently gather dough together into a ball. Divide in half, and flatten each half into a 1-inch-thick disc. Wrap each disc in plastic wrap and chill in the</p> 
			<p>refrigerator for at least 30 minutes. For best results, chill for 4 hours, or up to 2 days.</p>
			<li><strong>Step 4: </strong></li>
			<p>When ready to use, roll dough on a lightly floured surface, being careful not to overwork it.</p>
            <li><strong>Step 5: </strong></li>
            <p>Fit dough into a pie plate. If it crumbles or tears as you work it, just pinch and press it back into shape.</p>
            <li><strong>Step 6: </strong></li>
            <p>Use as directed in your pie recipe.</p>
